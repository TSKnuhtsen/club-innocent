Profitability Framework
	- Profits
		- Revenue
			- Revenue / Unit
			- # Units Sold
		- Cost
			- Cost / Unit
				- Variable Cost
				- Fixed Cost
			- # of units Sold

REVENUE
	1. FOR PROBLEM BRANCH, SEGMENT THE NUMBER, BREAK IT INTO COMPONENT PARTS, COMPARE IT TO HISTORICAL.
	2. ISOLATE THE KEY DRIVER CAUSING BULK PROBLEM
	3. EXPLORE POSSIBLE RESOLUTIONS

	POSSIBLE SEGMENTATIONS
		- PRODUCT / PRODUCT LINE
		- DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL
		- REGION
		- CUSTOMER TYPE (NEW/OLD, BIG/SMALL)
		- INDUSTRY VERTICAL

	USUALLY A GENERAL MARKET ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK
		- START WITH CUSTOMER DEMAND SIDE

COSTS
	1. FOR PROBLEM BRANCH, SEGMENT INTO LOGICAL COMPONENTS
		- LOGICAL COMPONENTS
		- VALUE CHAIN
			- IDENTIFY FIXED COSTS IN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING
				- RAW MATERIALS -> FACTORY -> DISTRIBUTION -> CUSTOMERS
		- COMPARE TO HISTORICAL. FIND THE PROBLEM.

WHEN "UNITS SOLD" DECLINE, IT'S USEFUL TO COMPARE THE COMPANY'S NUMBERS TO IT'S COMPETITORS TO DETERMINE IF IT'S AN INDUSTRY-WIDE OR COMPANY-SPECIFIC ISSUE.


BUSINESS SITUATION FRAMEWORK
NEW MARKET ENTRY, NEW PRODUCT, NEW BUSINESS, HOW TO GROW, STRATEGY, TURNAROUND, COMPANY POSITION ASSESSMENT

CUSTOMER
	- WHO IS THE CUSTOMER?
		- IDENTIFY SEGMENTS (SEGMENT SIZE, GROWTH RATE, % OF TOTAL MARKET)
		- COMPARE CURRENT YEAR METRICS TO HISTORICAL METRICS (LOOK FOR TRENDS)
	- wHAT DOES EACH CUSTOMER SEGMENT WANT? (IDENTIFY KEY NEEDS)
	- WHAT PRICE IS EACH SEGMENT WILLING TO PAY? (DETERMINE PRICE POINTS AND PRICE ELASTICITY / SENSITIVITY)
	- DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL PREFERENCE FOR EACH SEGMENT
	- CUSTOMER CONCENTRATION AND POWER (DOES ON CUSTOMER CONTROL ALL THE DEMAND?)

PRODUCT
	- NATURE OF PRODUCT (THINK OUT LOUD ABOUT THE PRODUCT, IT'S BENEFITS AND WHY SOMEONE WOULD BUY IT)
	- COMMODITY GOOD OR EASILY DIFFERENTIABLE GOODS (COULD COMPANY INCREASE DIFFERENTIATION?)
	- IDENTIFY COMPLIMENTARY GOODS (CAN WE PIGGY BACK OFF GROWTH IN COMPLIMENTS OR NEAR COMPLIMENTS?)
	- IDENTIFY SUBSTITUTES (ARE WE VULNERABLE TO INDERECT COMPETITORS, NAMELY SUBSITTUTES?)
	- DETERMINE PRODUCT'S LIFECYCLE (NEW VS ALMOST OBSELETE)
	- PACKAGING  (WHAT'S BUNDLEDED, INCLUDED AND CAN MAKE PRODUCT MORE LIKELY FOR CUSTOMER NEEDS?)

COMPANY
	- CAPABILITIES AND EXPERTISE
	- DISTRUBTION CHANNELS
	- COST STRUCTURE (FIXED VS VARIABLE?, BETTER TO HAVE HIGH FIXED COST = BARRIER TO ENTRY, COMPARE TO INDUSTRY!!)
	- INTANGIBLES (BRANDS, BRAND LOYALTY)
	- FINANCIAL SITUATION
	- ORGANIZATIONAL (IS TEAM ORGANIZED IN CONFLICT WITH HOW CUSTOMERS WANT TO DO BUSINESS?)

COMPETITION
	- COMPETITOR CONCENTRATION & STRUCTURE (MONOPOLY, OLIGOPOLY, COMPETITVE, MARKET SHARE)
	- BEST BEHAVIORS (TARGET CUSTOMER SEGMENTS, PRODUCTS, PRICING STRATEGY, DISTRIBUTION, BRAND LOYALTY?)
	- BEST PRACTICES (ARE THEY DOING THINGS WE ARE NOT?)
	- BARRIERS TO ENTRY (DO WE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT NEW ENTRANTS?)
	- SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION
	- INDUSTRY REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
	- LIFE-CYCLE OF INDUSTRY
