	- $2M FOR AGING; $2.5M FOR AD/ADRD
	- REQUIRES A COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN
	- DEMONSTRATED FEASIBILITY THROUGH OTHER FUNDING SOURCES
	- ABILITY TO OUTSOURCE 50% OF ACTIVITIES
	- PROJECT DIRECTOR / PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR PRIMARY EMPLOYMENT >50% MUST BE WITH SMALL BUSINESS FOR DURATION OF THE PERIOD

https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/sbir/nia-small-business-research-priorities
	- SPECIFIC INTERESTS:
		- ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY, DEVICES AND MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR OLDER ADULTS AND CAREGIVERS
			- *** - HOW DO I SPIN MY SHIT AS AD/RD FOR $2.5M???

https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/how-to-apply/before-you-apply#register-company-card
	- SAM = REGISTERED (NEED TO WAIT 2 WEEKS)
	- eRA Commons = NEED UID FROM SAM.GOV
	- Grants.gov = AUTOMATICALLY IS COMPLETED VIA SAM
	- SBA COMPANY REGISTRY = REQUIRES UEI AS WELL. LOL

https://seed.nih.gov/small-business-funding/how-to-apply/before-you-apply#talk-with-staff-card
	- TALK THROUGH YOUR IDEA WITH NIH STAFF
		- WHAT PROBLEM ARE YOU TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHY IS IT A PROBLEM?
		- WHAT'S YOUR TECHNOLOGY/RESEARCH IDEA TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM?
		- WHAT IS YOUR APPROACH (E.G. PROTOTYPE, MOCK-UP AND FOCUS GROUPS, ANALYSIS)?
		- WHO NEEDS AND WOULD USE YOUR SOLUTION? WHAT'S THE MARKETPLACE?

https://www.niaid.nih.gov/grants-contracts/draft-specific-aims
	- Need to understand Funding Opportunity Announcement
		- R01 = 4 - 5 years?
			- *** - LOOKS LIKE 1 - 3 YEARS?
	- Beware of concepts that can't be strongly support by your own preliminary data or published data from other laboratories
	- WHAT OBJECTIVES COULD YOU RESONABLE ACHIEVE WITHIN TIMEFRAME OF A GRANT?
	- EMPHASIS ON SIGNIFICANCE; GENERATING EXPERIMENTS WITH CLEAR ENDPOINTS
		- 2 - 4 ENDPOINTS, MOST PEOPLE DO 3
	- DO "DOES A CAUSE B OR NON-B?"
		- NON-B OUTCOME NEEDS TO MAKE SENSE BASED ON BOTH YOUR CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS AND PRELIMINARY DATA
	- DON'T MAKE DESCRIPTIVE FINDINGS PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL
		- DON'T TALK ABOUT HOW MANY BEDS WE'RE GONNA DO THIS ON
	- A STRONG HYPOTHESIS SHOULD BE WELL-FOCUSED AND TESTABLE BY THE SPECIFIC AIMS AND EXPERIMENTS


SPECIFIC AIMS
	- CALL BUTTONS AND BED ALARMS
	- WELLNESS AND SAFETY ALERTS
	- INCONTINENCE SENSOR

PRE-COMMERCIALIZATION
	- BED SENSORS
		- LOT
		- DEPLOYED
	- INTEGRATE SIRENS
	- ALIS + PCC INTEGRATION
	- TECHNICAL AUDIT
	- LEGAL REVIEW + BUSINESS INSURANCE

SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL MERIT
	- SCIENTIFIC MERIT
		- BCG PAPERS FROM MURATA
	- TECHNICAL MERIT
		- ENTERPRISE-GRADE ZIGBEE MESH NETWORKS

R44
	- 2 - 3 YEARS OF SUPPORT

CROSSROADS CONSULTING SBIR PHASE II
	- Summary
		- PROBLEM STATEMENT
		- PHASE I RESEARCH
			- **CENTRAL PURPOSE** / WHAT WE ALREADY DID
				- 3 DEGREE OF FREEDOM SLIP-TESTER
				- DEVELOPMENT OF A UI TO PROGRAM AND CONTROL SLIP-TESTER
				- DEVELOPMENT OF ALGORITHMS TO ACHIEVE DESIRED FORCE, SLIDING SPEED AND SHOE-FLOOR ANGLE PROFIELS
				- DEMONSTRATION OF THE IMPACT OF TESTING CONDITIONS ON THE ABILITY TO PREDICT SLIPS
			- **RATIONALE** 
				- DELIVER RIGOROUS TESTING EQUIPMENT TO REACH NEW MARKETS, TARGETING THOSE WHO CANNOT CURRENTLY AFFORD SHOE-LFOOR FRICTION ASSESSMENT EQUIPMENT (COMMERCIALIZATION)
				- POTENTIAL MARKET
				- BENEFITS OF REACHING POTENTIAL MARKET
				- 
	- SPECIFIC AIMS
		- AIM 1 = DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM TO BEST PREDICT SLIP EVENTS BASED ON AFOREMENTIONED FEATURES
			- ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT
		- AIM 2 = DEVELOP A SLIP-TESTER THAT IS PORTABLE, INEXPENSIVE AND BIOFEDLIC
			- HARDWARE COMPONENT
		- AIM 3 = QUANTIFY REPRODUCIBILITY AND REPEATABILITY OF THE DEVICE USING AN INTEERLABORATORY STUDY. INTER-DEVICE VARIABILITY AND INTERLABORATORY VARIABILITY USING 3 DEVICES AND 5 LABORATORIES.
			- PERFORMANCE OF THE DEVICE
		- AIM 4 = COMBINE ALGORITHM DEVELOPMENT + HARDWARE COMPONENT AND CHECK FEASABILITY

	- SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION = HARDWARE PRODUCT (OPEN?) + SOFTWARE = COMMERCIALIZATION PLAN
